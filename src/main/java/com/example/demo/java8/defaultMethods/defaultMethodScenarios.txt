Scenario 1 - 2 interfaces have same default method with either same/diff implementation.
If class is implementing both interfaces then class will have ambiguity so class should override default method
 and gives its own implementation/or call method from implemented interfaces

 e.g Override method{
    Interface1.super.defaultMethod();
    or
    Interface2.super.defaultMethod
 }

Scenario 2 - Same scenario 1 only one interface have same method as abstract and another interface have it as default.
Then class should override method and gives its own implementation or call method from interface where 
it is implemented with super keyword.

Scenario 3 - Inteface1 have default method. Interface2 is extending Interface1 without defining 
default method again. If Implementing class implementing Interface2 then it will have default
method implementation from Inteface1 

Scenario 4 - Interface1 have default method. Interface2 is extending Interface1 and defining same default method as 
abstract.If class is implementing both Interface1 and Interface2 then class needs to override the method and need to give its own 
implementation only. We can not call default method from Interface1 because we can not bypass the more specific 
super type i.e Interface2

Scenario 5 - Interface1 have default method. Interface2 is extending Interface1 and implementing same default method again
by giving its own implementation.If class is implementing both Interface1 and Interface2 then class can call  defaultMethod
from Interface2 only as it is a immediate super type
